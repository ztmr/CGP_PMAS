PMAS also supports Anti-Virus solutions. At least Sophos and ClamAV.

Anti-virus protection cannot be generally done on CGP, even if
Stalker says they can. It's because of depedence on ExternalFilters.
ExternalCommands are not supported on all CGP's platforms.

There's opensource ClamAV port for OpenVMS.
You can find it on Alexey Chupahin's website:

I don't use anti-virus solutions.
Our computers are virus-aware by default ;-)
So why to spend system resources on virus filtering?
